# Minesweeper
An old minesweeper clone I made in high school. Uses SDL 1.2

Uncompress SDL.zip in `Minesweeper/Minesweeper/SDL/` to compile. Uses special version of SDLmain.lib that is compiled for visual studio 2015.

I made this in 2010 in my first programming class to show off at a school event.
I recompiled it in 2017 and uploaded it to github.
